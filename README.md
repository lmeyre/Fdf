fdf is a graphics project wich will show you a map in wireframe.

A map should be given, with coordinate, wich will tell the wireframe where to go, using X, Y and Z axis.

This project was made without using tools, almost "from scratch".
The graphics library would only allow me to choose the size of the window, and to choose a pixel and give it a color. No shape would form automatically.

Usage

To build:
```
$ make
```
To execute:
```
$ ./fdf maps/pylone.fdf
```
There is a lot of map to try in the maps folder, but you can also create your own.

After lauching the project, a manual will tell you about all the options and possibility, for move and change the appearance of map.

For more information, you can look at the pdf.
